# Crisp-DM
This folder is used for a Udacity Data Science Project - Crisp DM

## MOTIVATION:
The motivation from this project was to fulfill the requirements for the Udacity Data Science Citizen Crisp DM assignment. For it we were given a few datasets to choose from or find another interesting dataset from Kaggle. Thus I decided to search for some interesting dataset in Kaggle which matches my curiousity of travelling. One of my passions which I have is to sail with a cruise ship and before doing so to get acquinted with its risk and what a better place than learn from history.
Additionally, wanted to explore some conditional probabilities and providing some descriptive analysis before one jumps into supervised machine learning and construct a prediction model.

## USED FILEs:
Titanic_train.csv - data file
Titanic_test.csv – data file
Data Science Blog Post Crisp DM Process.ipynb - Jupiter Notebook file
Article_word – word file of the article
Artcile_pdf – Pdf version of the same article for the convenience of the user.

## ABOUT
During the project I have used Jupiter notebook with a version of python 3.0. For further tech specifications please look at the intro of the Jupiter notebook for the libraries applied. Please note, some of the sklearn libraries for Machine learning to be performed so the are prepared, however not used for the end results at this time. Subject to change in the future.
I have no copywrite license to the data, it is used solely for accomplishment of the Udacity assignment.

## TECH REQUIREMENTS
For the below project and succesfull Jupiter Notebook execution, please make sure the following packages have been installed and loaded:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn 


## RESULTS
The results are stored in the Jupiter notebook file described in the “USED FILEs”.

Final results in a form of an artcile is also being published on the following location:
